After completing the workshop, following things are learnt:
1. implement a copy constructor and a copy assignment operator. Overloading operators and applyung deep and shallow copy on calss objects
2. to manage a class with dynamic resources. Creating dynamic array and resizing it dynamically, to add more elements to it
3. to use existing objects to create new ones or to assign values to existing objects based on other existing ones
4. to implement custom input/output operators. Customising "cout<<" operator to print formatted output

While working on the files i came across following issues:
1. Creating Friend function definition and writing its body: While creating the friend function to override "<<" operator, i got, "too few parameters" passed error, and it was resolved by passing the object on which the function was being called.
